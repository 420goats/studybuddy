## Problem Statement

Studying is usually an isolated task. Without outside motivation, learners may struggle with procrastination and burnout. 

For example, it is easy to fall into a trap of doing something other than studying when you should be studying. However, when you receive a text or something similar from somebody who is actively working, youâ€™ll feel inspired to get your work done as well.

Prior solutions which are actively used are people hanging out with each other while they study. That said, people arenâ€™t always available to meet with each other in person.

How can we allow people to encourage each other to study through shared productivity while not needing to be physically available to each other in a manner that is social, scalable, and asynchronous.

We aim to solve this problem by creating a fun, interactive, asynchronous application that allows people to share when they are studying, encouraging their friends to join them and get some work done too.
